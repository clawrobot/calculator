Calculator App From Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Hello. This is my first calculator app ever after learning html, css and javascript! I'm very proud of this project because putting
something together that I believe looks good and actually works all by myself is very fulfilling. I'm sure there is some error
that can be found but I tried to work out all the possible edge cases.
